Problem of counting pigs

## Problem description

There are N pigs in a hog log. Select Q of them once. Then put them back. 
After M times selecting, ask the expectation value of the number (k) of pigs 
that have ever been selected.

The code 
* simulates the process of selecting pigs.
* gives recursion formula of the probability of (n, m, q, k) event.  
    That is, select from $n$ pigs $m$ times with $q$ each time that results 
    in $k$ pig(s) been selected.
